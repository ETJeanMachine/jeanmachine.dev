# jeanmachine.dev

This is a repository for my personal website, and it is powered by Svelte. To be able to run this project, or to make a Svelte project of your own, check out [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
yarn run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn run dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of this app:

```bash
yarn run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
