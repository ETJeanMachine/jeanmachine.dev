      Much of this website's content is built on top of the <a
        href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a
      >, to varying extents. The blog's content is stored on my PDS, or Personal
      Data Server, at
      <a href="https://pds.jeanmachine.dev">pds.jeanmachine.dev</a>.

      The format for the blog is built using <a href="leaflet.pub">Leaflet</a>
      and it's lexicons. Additionally, the styling for the website uses Leaflet's
      publication theme lexicon. This is so that if I make any thematic changes to
      my Leaflet blog at
      <a href="https://blog.jean.moe">blog.jean.moe</a>, it should be perfectly
      mirrored here as well.

      The core of the website is built using <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev"
        >SvelteKit</a
      >, for both the frontend and backend. Icons are provided by
      <a href="https://lucide.dev">Lucide</a>, and the font used is
      <a href="https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font">Maple Mono</a>.
      Cloudflare Pages is how I host the website. You can view the website's
      source code on my
      <a href="https://github.com/ETJeanMachine/jeanmachine.dev">Github</a>.

      Additionally, for the background art, I cannot help but seriously
      recommend the art of Nelson Wu, or <a href="https://onionlabs.carrd.co/"
        >OnionLabs</a
      >. I am a tremendous fan of his work, and I think you should be too. He
      has a store when he sells art prints, books, and various other neat
      things. You should definitely consider supporting!
