<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  My name's Eric, but I also go by Jean! I'm a software engineer from the
  Pacific Northwest with a degree in Computer Science. I love building all sorts
  of things, but in particular, the kinds of projects that get me going are the
  things that I know will positively impact people's lives.

<p>
  When I'm not coding, I enjoy biking, hiking, and attending city hall meetings,
  reading municipal planning documents too. I keep informed on what's going on
  in my community at all times - because I believe that staying involved is what
  enables me to make a better impact on the world.
